# Generic Ring Buffer (Circular Buffer) in C

This repository contains a lightweight, static-memory **Ring Buffer (Circular Buffer)** implementation designed for embedded systems. 

It is commonly used in **UART**, **SPI**, and **Audio processing** drivers to handle high-speed data streams without data loss, acting as a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Static Memory Allocation:** Uses a fixed-size `uint8_t` array, avoiding `malloc` and dynamic memory fragmentation risks (Critical for Microcontrollers).
* **O(1) Complexity:** Read and Write operations are constant time, ensuring deterministic performance for Real-Time systems.
* **Modulo Arithmetic:** Uses the `%` operator for efficient circular index wrapping.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Includes bool return types to indicate `Buffer Full` or `Buffer Empty` states, preventing data overwrites or invalid reads.

## 🛠️ Technical Concepts

* **Data Structures:** Struct-based encapsulation of buffer, head, and tail pointers.
* **Pointer Arithmetic:** Efficient passing of data by reference.
* **Memory Management:** Separation of logic (Head/Tail) from storage (Buffer Array).

## 💻 Code Example

```c
RingBuffer_t uart_buffer;
RingBuffer_Init(&uart_buffer);

// Write Data (Sensor/UART)
if (!RingBuffer_Write(&uart_buffer, 0xAA)) {
    // Handle Buffer Full Error
}

// Read Data (Processor)
uint8_t data;
if (RingBuffer_Read(&uart_buffer, &data)) {
    Process_Data(data);
}
